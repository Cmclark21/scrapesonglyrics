Buffalo soldier, dreadlock rasta
There was a buffalo soldier
In the heart of america

Stolen from africa, brought to america
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
I mean it, when i !@#^yse the stench

To me, it makes a lot of sense
How the dreadlock rasta was the buffalo soldier
And he was taken from africa, brought to america

Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival

Said he was a buffalo soldier, dreadlock rasta

Buffalo soldier, in the heart of america

If you know your history

Then you would know where you coming from
Then you wouldn't have to ask me
Who the heck do i think i am


I'm just a buffalo soldier
In the heart of america

Stolen from africa, brought to america
Said he was fighting on arrival
Fighting for survival

Said he was a buffalo soldier
Win the war for america


Dreadie, woe yoe yoe, woe woe yoe yoe
Woe yoe yoe yo, yo yo woe yo, woe yoe yoe
(repeat)

Buffalo soldier, trodding through the land
Said he wanna ran, then you wanna hand
Trodding through the land, yea, yea


Said he was a buffalo soldier
Win the war for america

Buffalo soldier, dreadlock rasta
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Driven from the mainland

To the heart of the caribbean

Singing, woe yoe yoe, woe woe yoe yoe

Woe yoe yoe yo, yo yo woe yo woe yo yoe
(repeat)


Trodding through san juan
In the arms of america
Trodding through jamaica, a buffalo soldier

Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Buffalo soldier, dreadlock rasta
Singing, woe yoe yoe, woe woe yoe yoe

Woe yoe yeo yo, yo yo woe yo woe yo yoe
