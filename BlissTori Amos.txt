Father I killed my monkey
I let it out to
Taste the sweet of spring

Wonder if I will wander out
Test my tether to
See if I'm still free from you

Steady as it comes
Right down to you
I've said it all
So maybe we're a bliss
Of another kind
I said a bliss
Of another kind
I said

Lately, I'm in to circuitry
What it means to be
Made of you but not enough of you

And I wonder if
You can bi locate, is that what I taste?
Your supernova juice
You know it's true, I'm a part of you

Steady as it comes
Right down to you
I've said it all
So maybe we're a bliss
Of another kind

I said steady as it comes
Right down to you
I've said it all
So maybe you're a four horse engine
With a power drive
I said a hot kachina who wants into mine
I said take it, take it with your terracide

And I said steady as it comes
Right down to you
I've said it all
So maybe we're a bliss
Of another kind
I said a bliss
Of another kind
I said a bliss
Of another kind
I said a bliss, a bliss, a bliss
Of another kind
